Open Banking
============================
This repository and the associated Wiki are a community resource. 
We want to facilitate quick and effective adoption for FinTech innovators.
A place to also share challenges 

This resource is organized into the following sections:

* **Wiki**
  * [Why Open Banking?](https://github.com/TyroFinTechHub/OpenBanking/wiki/Why-Open-Banking)
    * Open Banking principles
    * Countries with an Open Banking policy 
   * [Participants to come]
    * Contains a page of participants in order to maintain appropriate contact information
* **API Providers**
  * Each API Provider code base will have:
      * **API​**: Documentation that references product descriptions in the Wiki    
      * **Issues​**: Solutions to known bugs and references to solutions on StackOverflow
      * **Integrations​**: Solutions to convert external data sources into useful formats for databases, visualizations, etc...
 * **Data Providers**
   * Each Data Provider code base will be structured as three sub-folders:
      * **Datasets​**: Overtime, we hope to add providers and sample datasets relevant to this community.
      * **Issues​**: Solutions to known bugs and references to solutions on StackOverflow
      * **Integrations​**: Solutions to convert external data sources into useful formats for databases, visualizations, etc...
* **Chat**
  * Some problems we face require **communication, not code**.  For this, we'll set up Telegram or Slack.
  * Go there to share your company updates, ask for help and help another entrepreneur / data-geek out.
  * Stay posted!

## Contribution Guidelines
We rely on putting together quality resources for you all to succeed. To keep this useful for others: 
 
* Keep reviews and descriptions of resources API and data providers in the Wiki
* All programming languages are welcome
* Programs that rely on multiple files should be placed in their own sub-folder
* Some have had success purely working from the provider's documentation. 
* If there was any documentation you found particularly helpful, either link it, or add it to the repo.

### Contribution Inspiration
Contributions should detail any/some/all of the following items:
  * Which APIs/Datasets you're currently using and how you're accessing them
  * How you're using the APIs/Datasets
  * General experience with the APIs/Datasets and tips to facilitate the process for new startups and innovators
  * Addition of example datasets or ingest scripts that you found helpful
